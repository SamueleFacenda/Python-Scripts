Not so simple in the end, features:
- multithreading (more than 20 take down the website)
- persistency (data are saved in a relational db, for a complete list just look 
at ![sqlalchemy](https://sqlalchemy.org))
- db update operation optimization
- cli utility
- json saving option (there should be a tag to the right commit)

TODO:
- [ ] web ui for fantasy tabletennis
- [ ] player auction
- [ ] formation management (choose 3 players)
